# ðŸ¤– Weather.com QA Automation Scope

**Project Name:** Weather.com QA Automation Project  
**Prepared By:** Rahanul Patwary (QA Lead)  
**Date:** May 18, 2025

## 1. Purpose
This document outlines the strategy and boundaries for automating QA testing for Weather.com. The goal is to increase efficiency, test coverage, and maintainability through a scalable automation framework using industry-standard tools and practices.

---

## 2. Automation Objectives

- Automate high-priority functional test cases for critical user workflows  
- Develop and maintain a regression test suite for release validation  
- Integrate automated tests with a CI/CD pipeline for real-time feedback  
- Generate clear, actionable reports to aid in debugging and stakeholder review  
- Create a reusable, scalable, and maintainable automation architecture  

---

## 3. Scope of Automation

### âœ… In Scope:
- Weather search (valid/invalid inputs)  
- Navigation (desktop/mobile)  
- Video playback & interaction  
- Ads loading & redirection  
- Account login/logout (if applicable)  
- Cross-browser testing: Chrome, Firefox, Edge  
- Mobile view validation via browser emulation or real devices  
- Accessibility tests (keyboard navigation)  
- Regression testing suite  
- Smoke test suite for rapid health checks  

### ðŸš« Out of Scope (for now):
- Backend/API testing (unless API keys are obtained)  
- Performance/load testing (JMeter or similar needed)  
- Security testing  
- Advanced accessibility (beyond keyboard/tab checks)  
- Full mobile app automation (outside browser scope)

## 4. Tools & Technology Stack

| Purpose                | Tool                |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Programming Language   | Java                |
| Test Framework         | TestNG              |
| Browser Automation     | Selenium WebDriver  |
| Build & Dependency Mgmt| Maven               |
| WebDriver Management   | WebDriverManager    |
| Logging                | Log4j2              |
| Reporting              | ExtentReports       |
| CI/CD Pipeline         | Jenkins (Local)     |
| Version Control        | Git & GitHub        |
| IDE                    | Eclipse             |

## 5. Test Design Guidelines

- Use Page Object Model (POM) for clean separation  
- Group test cases using TestNG annotations  
- Leverage Maven lifecycle for build/test execution  
- Centralize utility classes (click, wait, input, etc.)  
- Use `@Listeners` and retry logic to stabilize flaky tests  
- Capture screenshots and logs on failure  

---

## 6. Parallel Execution & Isolation

- Enable parallel execution with TestNG  
- Each test should:
  - Use independent WebDriver instances  
  - Be self-contained and stateless  
  - Tear down any data/environment it uses  

---

## 7. Error Handling & Reporting

- Use Log4j2 for granular logging  
- On failure:
  - Capture screenshots  
  - Log stack trace + failure message  
  - Embed in ExtentReports  
- Generate HTML reports post-run  
- Optionally email reports via Jenkins  

---

## 8. CI/CD Integration (Planned)

Jenkins Flow:

- Pull code from GitHub  
- Run tests via `mvn clean test`  
- Publish ExtentReports  
- Send email notifications (optional)  
- GitHub Workflow: feature branches â†’ PRs â†’ merge to main  

---

## 9. Test Environment

| Component        | Configuration             |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| Local Machine    | Windows 10/11             |
| Browsers         | Chrome, Firefox, Edge     |
| Emulated Devices | Chrome DevTools           |
| Real Devices     | Android/iOS (manual or Appium later) |

---

## 10. Maintenance Strategy

- Update locators as UI changes  
- Maintain versioned test data  
- Refactor modules frequently  
- Archive reports/logs (GitHub or Jenkins)  
- Use GitHub Issues to log automation bugs  

---

## 11. Deliverables

- Selenium + Maven test framework (Java)  
- Executable TestNG suites  
- HTML reports via ExtentReports  
- Logging system (Log4j2)  
- Jenkins CI setup (local)  
- Full GitHub repository  
- Final automation documentation  

---

## 12. Risks & Assumptions

- Dynamic content (ads, videos) may cause flaky tests  
- UI changes require locator maintenance  
- Local/cloud test discrepancies possible  
- Full API/mobile automation needs added tools  
- GitHub and Jenkins integration must be maintained
